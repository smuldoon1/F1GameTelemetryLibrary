# F1 Game Telemetry Library

### This library can be used to help develop applications that make use of the UDP packets sent by the F1 games.

The main functionality is the handling of listening to ports and unpacking the UDP packets. These packets are stored in F1Packet classes that can be used in an application for displaying telemetry data, storing session histories etc.
